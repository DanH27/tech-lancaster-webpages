      <li>Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.</li>
      <li>Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.</li>
      <li>Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. </li>
      <li>Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.</li>
      <li>Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.</li>
      <li>Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members and participating organizations remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</li>
